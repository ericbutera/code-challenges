# Code Challenges

This repository serves as a running history of the various problems I have studied. The aim is for me to build out knowledge & skills while also being able to refresh as needed.

Most of the code samples are HackerRand & leetcode challenges. I have also added a few 'anonymous' interview challenges as well. 

## Running
For the ruby examples:
```bash
gem install rspec
rspec path/to/challenge/code_test.rb
```
